<h3> Monolithic => Single Container forming an application </h3>

=> Movie App

	-> Login feature
	-> Signup feature
	-> Add Movie 
	-> Get movies

=> Challenges

	-> Inflexible : Cant use idfferent technologies to form the app
	
	-> Unreliable : One feature of the system doesnt work entire system doesnt work
	
	-> Unscalable : Every time you have to rebuild application and scale it (increase the virtual memory 
                    or processing capacity on it)
                    
	-> Blocking :	During development -> signup -> add address field -> rebuild 

	-> Slow Build : Deployment time/build time is slow.


<h3> Microservices => Multiple containers forming a block </h3>

=> Movie App

	-> Login service :	SpringBoot with H2Database -> not running -> dont have to rebuild for scaling/
                        updating a feature -> build time low
                        
	-> Signup service : SpringBoot with MongoDB -> running

	-> Add Movie : 		NodeJs with MySQL -> running
